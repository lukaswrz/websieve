# websieve

A reverse proxy that adds user authentication to any user-facing web
application.

## Why use this rather than HTTP basic authentication?

Unlike basic authentication, this uses a regular webpage that browser
extensions can interact with. This is specifically useful for password manager
browser exensions. It's also possible to customize the HTML and CSS via a
custom template.
